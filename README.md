## Jared AWS notes aug 24 2022

# 1) advantages of cloud computing 

• cloud computing is the process of having information storeed in mass off site from where it originates. 

# 2) goals and benifits 
• cloud computing is efficient for business and helps to cut costs for those who do not want to have their own server room

• clouds can instantly allocate IT resorces to other places 

• increases scalability

• companies need to handle big influxes of traffic in small windows of time 

• Increases vulnerability to control, licensing, regulation, limited portability

• user centric

• assessable 

• task centric 

• variable expess 

• reduce cost of operating data centers 

• stop guessing how much space you will need

• go global in minuetes 

• AWS has the most redundancy 

# 3) concepts and Tech

Cloud is a distinct IT environment for remotely provisions of scalable and measured it resource

• Hardware-based or Software base

• Can have server rooms and have dictated equipment and bases for the Cloud Servies

• Can handle the scaling for increase and decrease usage demands

• Client and the way to access

# 4) Challenges of cloud computing 

• everything is logged even the logs of the logs

• all devices are monitored even when on wifi networks 

• AWS Trusted Advisor

• AWS Account Teams


• AWS Enterprise Support

• AWS Partner Network

• AWS Professional Services

• AWS Marketplace

• AWS Security Bulletins

• AWS Security Documentation

# 5) what is a network

• two or more client machines connected to eachother 

• requires a network device (router) 

• main purpose is to communicate 

• network does not specifically have to be two computers 

• LAN (local area network) home networks, school, work ect

• WAN (wide area network) internet, world wide web, ex: google facebook / all FANG companies 

• OSI open source interconnection; the 7 layer moodel 

• MAC ADDRESS physical address of the device (not human readable)

• IP address a 4 part unique address ie 192.786.2.5

• Port a channel through which specific data can be sent 

• dns is vulnerable to hacking 




## what is the internet?

a global network of interconnected smaller networks

world wide web - sub set of the internet 

URI - uniform resource ID 

DNS server domain -- name server or just another name for server 

# 6) OSI 7 layer model 

• application layer -- human interaction layer user intercace 

• presentation layer -- shows data in useable format

• session layer -- maintains connection and is responsible for port and session control

• transport layer -- transmits data using transmission protocalls (TCP & UDP)

• network layer -- decides which physical path the user takes 

• datalink layer -- defines the format of the data network

• physical layer -- transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium

# 7) sub nets

• sub nets allow for communities to be created around a system

• sub nets act like post offices for information 

• sub nets allow for more efficient transportation of info 

 
# 8) ENI instances (elastic network interface)

• one or more 2nd addresses from the VPC (virtual private cloud)

• public v4 address 

• includes descriptions 

# 9) NAT device / NAT TABLE (Network Address Translation table)

• allows for instances to connect to the internet 

• aws takes care of database and NAT takes care of private networks 

• keeps internet activity compartmentalized 

# 10) SVPC (shared virtual private clouds)

• allows for devices to share data 

• only occurs in the same organization 

• different from centralized cloud structure 

• allows for more secure ownership 

• allows for better security 

• allows for IDS to be seen with VPNS 


# 11) VPC peering / VPC (virtual private cloud)
 
• connected to central hub for simplicity 

• allows for two clouds to connect to each other 

• two accounts can use the same account while remaining on their own accounts 

# 12 what is a VPN? (virtual private network)

• A virtual private network extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.

 •allows for access to remote data centers 
 
• allows for more access to private data centers 

# 13) end points 

• end points are vitual devices that allow vpc to connect to aws and does not require vpn connection and need three different end points to work
